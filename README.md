# About This Repo

This repo is an exercise done following the tutorials in the book Discover Meteor.

Awesome book to get start with Meteor.js: <https://www.discovermeteor.com/>

Helpful links:

- Atmosphere, the Meteor packages: <https://atmospherejs.com/>
- Meteor.js: <https://www.meteor.com/>

# My Notes

- When read tutorials, don't use `mrt`, use `meteor` directly (`mrt` is outdated)
- Meteor preference:
  - Meteor will run `/lib` first, then others by filename a-z, and `main.*` stuff at the end


# Worth Mention

Some of the tools I use happily:

- Macbook Air 13"
- use `brew` to install `nvm` to manage `npm`
- Chrome browser
- Atom Editor (yah!)
- Terminal-Plus Atom package (so I can operate a few terminals within Atom in full screen mode)
- I write a lot of Coffeescript, Jade, SCSS w/ Compass: `meteor add coffeescript mquandalle:jade fourseven:scss francocatena:compass`
